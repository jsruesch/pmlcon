                    Dr. Jodi Asbell-Clarke is the director of the Educational Gaming Environments Group (EdGE) at TERC. TERC is a non-profit research and development organization focusing on innovative, technology-based math and science education where Jodi leads EdGE at TERC, a team of game designers, educators, and researchers who are studying how STEM learning in digital games can embrace neurodiversity. EdGE at TERC develops innovative learning technologies and research methods to understand what learners know through what they can do, not just what they say. Jodi’s academic background includes a MA in Math, an MSc in Astrophysics and a PhD in Education. Early in her career, Jodi dreamed of being an astronaut and went to Houston where she was an onboard software verification analyst for IBM during the first 25 missions of the space shuttle. Later Jodi taught Physics and Astrophysics to some of the brightest students in the country at the laboratory school at University of Illinois. In 1993, she came to TERC and led several science education projects at TERC involving curriculum development, professional development of teachers, and educational research. In 2009, she co-founded EdGE with her colleagues to study how game-based learning can transform science education.
